2. **Customize Export**:
   - **Video Codec**: Choose H.264 (MP4), H.265 (HEVC), or WebM (VP9)
   - **CRF**: Select or enter a custom quality value (lower is higher quality, 20 is default, full FFmpeg range supported)
   - **FPS**: Choose or enter output frame rate (24, 30, 60, 120, or any custom value)
   - **Audio Bitrate**: Select or enter audio quality (64kâ€“320k, or choose "Remove Audio" to export video without audio)
   - **Resolution**: Choose from 4K, 2K, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, or enter a custom resolution (e.g., 236x556)
3. **Hide Advanced Options**: Uncheck "Advanced" to return to simple mode (defaults: H.264, CRF 20, 120 FPS, 128k audio, 1920x1080)
