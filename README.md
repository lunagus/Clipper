# Clipper - Trimmer, Encoder & Uploader

A minimal, modern, and accessible GUI application for video trimming and encoding using FFmpeg. Built with Python and Tkinter, Clipper provides an intuitive interface for video processing and uploading tasks with a clean, dark material-inspired design.

## WHY?

I wanted a quick, intuitive way to clip and encode video files from movies, game captures, and TV shows for personal use. Manually crafting FFmpeg commands every time was tedious and inefficient, especially due to different size constraints and resolution tweaks for every use case, so I built a lightweight GUI that covers most of the useful FFmpeg options, while remaining lightweight and fast, and adding upload and sharing features when needed.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¬ Core Functionality
- **Video File Support**: Browse for input video files (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WMV, FLV, WebM)
- **Trimming**: Optional video trimming with interactive timeline and seekbar
- **Auto Output Generation**: Intelligent filename generation with sanitization
- **Encoding Presets**: Choose from Very Fast, Fast, Medium, Slow, Very Slow encoding presets
- **Advanced Export Options**: Enable advanced mode to customize video codec, CRF, FPS, audio bitrate, container format, playback speed and resolution (including custom values)
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Export to MP4, MKV or WebM with automatic extension handling
- **File Uploading**: Optionally lets you send your processed video directly to great file hosting websites, choose your preferred service, upload with one click, and instantly get a shareable URL.

### ðŸŽ¨ User Interface
- **Modern Dark Theme**: Clean, material-inspired UI with high contrast and pill-style buttons
- **Interactive Timeline**: Click and drag handles for precise start/end trimming
- **Responsive Design**: Auto-adjusting layout with dynamic resizing
- **Advanced Mode Toggle**: Show/hide expert-level encoding controls
- **Editable Dropdowns**: Fields allow preset or custom input with validation
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Status updates, error messages, and progress bars

### âš¡ Performance
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user feedback
- **Threaded Processing**: Runs encoding and upload tasks in background threads to avoid UI freezes
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized command execution avoids unnecessary memory usage
